### Energy Usage Prediction for eSC
#### Overview
This repository contains our work as consultants for eSC, focusing on predicting future energy consumption and providing insights to enhance energy efficiency. Our current project revolves around forecasting energy usage during the month of July—historically the hottest month of the year—when energy demand is typically at its peak. The goal is to aid eSC in optimizing their power grid usage, reducing the risk of blackouts, and promoting environmentally friendly practices.
